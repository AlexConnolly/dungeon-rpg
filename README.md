# dungeon-rpg
I've always wanted to build a topdown 2D RPG that I could play as a sandbox.

I've been fascinated with creation since a kid, playing lego and eventually Minecraft. Giving people the building blocks to build something, whilst connecting them with a world to build it in has always inspired me. There is something fundamentally beautiful about having a world to call your own.

I have wanted to start on this project for about 10 years. Infact, honestly, I've tried to start it before. But I've realised the problems came from the fact that previously I tried to complete it all in one go. This time, I intend to work on it for as long as I need to.

I might spend weeks committing daily. I might not commit for months. But the goal here is to create what I have always wanted to create; an RPG I can have fun in without the complexities or microtransactions that come with modern games. It'll be simple to play. It will be joyous. It will allow you to have as much fun as you want. And it'll be extendable.
